You have probably used NPM so far. NPM is the name for two things:

- A package library: <https://npmjs.com>
- A package manager: `npm` (which you can use to run `npm install PACKAGE`)

1. Read through [this introduction to npm][introduction-to-npm]
2. Publish a package to npm using [NPM's tutorial][publishing-to-npm]. You won't
   have to follow every step.
