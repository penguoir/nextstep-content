SASS is a tool that compiles your CSS files. SASS adds features to CSS to make
it more scaleable. For example, variables, functions, and nesting.

1. Read through [this gist that goes through SASS examples][sass-examples].

- SASS is very useful for building big CSS projects. For example, if you're
building a CSS framework, you would use SASS. However, for smaller projects,
it's not necessary.
