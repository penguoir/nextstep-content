Instead of making an HTML file for each page, developers use static site
generators to do this for them. For example, you can make a template for "blog
post", then reuse it for all your articles instead of copy-pasting for each one.

  1. Make [the quickstart Jekyll project][jekyll-quickstart]. You might have to
  tinker with your development environment for this to work.
  2. Make a Jekyll website with a customised theme using [this tutorial][jekyll-custom-theme-tutorial].
  3. Read through [this page on Hugo][hugo-introduction].
