Instead of hand-writing an HTML file for each page in a website, developers use
static site generators to do this for them.

For example, you can make a template for "blog post", then reuse it for all your
articles instead of copy-pasting the HTML for each one. In the end, the static
site generator creates an HTML file for each one. You can then serve these files
using a server such as GitHub Pages or Vercel.

Static sites are perfect for building blogs, documentation, and personal
websites. They don't work as well for big sites that have a lot of complexity.

1. Make [the quickstart Jekyll project][jekyll-quickstart]. You might have to

2. Make a Jekyll website with a customised theme using [this tutorial][jekyll-step-by-step].
3. Read through [this page on Hugo][hugo-introduction].
