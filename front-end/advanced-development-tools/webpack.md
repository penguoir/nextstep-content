So far, you may have encountered some problems with your JavaScript files:

- Your JavaScript files are long, so they are annoying to edit.
- Your HTML files have lots of `<script>` tags, which are becoming cumbersome.

The standard solution to these problems is Webpack.

Webpack allows you to:

- Split your JavaScript files into smaller ones, making them easier to manage.
- Bundles all of your JavaScript into one file, which is easy to import into
your HTML.
- Run programs on your JavaScript to make the final code better

- Webpack's documentation has fancy words like 'static module bundler',
  'dependency graph', and 'tree shaking'. Don't worry about these terms too
  much, they're talking about the implementation of Webpack, so you don't need
  to understand them unless you do advanced work with it.
- Babel takes your JavaScript code and changes it, so it works on every browser.
- Webpack can do a lot more than what you've seen in this chapter. If it
interests you, work through [the Webpack guides][webpack-guides]
