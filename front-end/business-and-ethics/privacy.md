Popular websites often collect data on individuals using their site. Some
examples of the data they collect include:

* How many people visit each page of a website
* How often do people return to a website
* At what time do people access the website

This kind of anonymised analytics helps business. Businesses can look at the
data and get ideas on how to improve their website.

But, there are sites which collect data on individuals. This infringes on
privacy. There are sites which collect data on the following:

* Where the person accessing their site lives
* Social status of the person accessing the site
* Relationship status of person accessing the site
* Which other webistes the user has visited

This kind of a data collection helps businesses as they can use an algorithm to
decide which advertisements to show the user. Better advertisements means more
money for the business. However, the data they collect is infringing on users'
privacy.

Imagine if, to read a newspaper, you first had to send a form with your social
status, relationship status, and home address. Nobody would read the newspaper!
Online, this data is collected without the user knowing, so they still access
websites.

Some users think "What should I care? I have nothing to hide!" There are plenty
of reasons these users should care too, as shown in the first task below.

**When you make websites, don't infringe on privacy. Instead, collect essential,
anonymized data.**

Some services provide useful functionality, but infringe on user privacy. For
example, Google Analytics, Google Fonts, and the Facebook pixel.
