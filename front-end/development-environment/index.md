**If you don't know what to use, use [Replit][replit].**

If you can, use an online system, especially one of the following:

* [Replit][replit]: Great for trying out small projects. Not great for custom setups, e.g. TypeScript.
* **Code Sandbox**: Alternative to Replit.
* **Google Cloud Shell**: Requires some work but great for more complicated setups, e.g. Webpack, TypeScript

[replit]: https://replit.com/

If you encounter problems with these, consider:

* **Google Cloud Compute virtual machines**: Computers running on Google's
    servers that you can access from your computer.

When all else fails, use your personal computer to work on code.
