Your development environment is where you code. For example, your PC or your
laptop.

**If you just want to start coding, go to [Replit]**

If you can, use an online system to write code, especially one of the following:

* [Replit][replit]: Great for trying out small projects. Not great for custom
setups, e.g. TypeScript.
* [Code Sandbox][code-sandbox]: Alternative to Replit.
* [Google Cloud Shell][google-cloud-shell]: Requires some work but great for
more complicated setups, e.g. Webpack, TypeScript

[replit]: https://replit.com/
[code-sandbox]: https://codesandbox.io/
[google-cloud-shell]: https://cloud.google.com/shell/

These websites let you code without setting anything up. This means you save
time and focus on the important part: learning to code.

If you encounter problems with these, consider:

* **Google Cloud Compute virtual machines**: Computers running on Google's
servers that you can access from your computer.

When all else fails, use your personal computer to work on code. This means you
have to set up all the tools yourself.
