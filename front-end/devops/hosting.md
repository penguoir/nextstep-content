You can't serve your site from your computer. If your computer shuts down or
needs to restart, your site goes down. Also, hackers could get into your local
network and steal your information if your code has security flaws.

Luckily, big companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft rent out their
computers to whoever wants them. You can run your code on their servers for a
fee.

These services also provide specialised computers which do specific tasks, for
example, run a database. The specialists at these companies work on the
database, so you don't have to set it up yourself.

However, having access to a computer is still not very helpful. You have to do
various tasks which you would probably instead not do. For example:

* Set up a server without any security vulnerabilities.
* Copy in the latest code every time you make a change.
* Set up the environment in the server (installing `npm`, `node`, etc.)

There are better solutions, though. More abstracted computers where you upload
code, and they do the rest. Some examples of these services are:

* Vercel
* Heroku
* Firebase
* Netlify
* GitHub pages (static only)

  1. Upload a project to each of the above services.
  2. Set up a website on Amazon Web Services.

**Note:** As a front-end web developer, this usually isn't your problem.
But, it's good to have an idea of how this all works. Also, if you want to
publish your website, you should know how to do so correctly.
