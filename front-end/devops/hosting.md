For people to visit your website, a computer needs to send HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript files to the user's computer. The computer that sends these files is
called a "server".

You should not use your computer as a server. If your computer shuts down or
needs to restart, your site goes down. Also, hackers could get into your local
network and steal your information if your server has security flaws.

Luckily, big companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft rent out their
computers to whoever wants them. You can run your code on their computers for a
fee.

However, having access to a computer is still not very helpful. You have to
manually do various tasks which you would probably prefer not to do. For
example:

* Ensuring there are no security vulnerabilities
* Copying in the latest code every time you make a change.
* Setting up and maintaining the computer's environment (installing `npm`,
`node`, etc.)

There are solutions to these problems. Instead of accessing just a computer,
some online services provide platforms where you just have to upload code. They
handle the rest.

Some popular websites include:

* Vercel
* Heroku
* Google Firebase
* Netlify
* GitHub pages (static only)

  1. Upload a project to each of the above services. (They are all free.)
  2. Set up a website on Amazon Web Services.

**Note:** As a front-end web developer, this usually isn't your problem.
But, it's good to have an idea of how this all works. Also, if you want to
publish your website, you should know how to do so.
