This section helps you gain familiarity with some production aspects of web
development.

Every company has different ways of shipping their code to their users. Some
websites have developers working in the live version, where every change is
reflected to their users immediately. Other companies have a development
environment, which the public can't access, where the developers can try out
changes.

When working on a new project, ask about the system in place before making
changes. Repositories will often have a file called `CONTRIBUTING` to explain
how to make changes to their code.
