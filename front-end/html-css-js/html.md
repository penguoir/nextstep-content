Although you can present content using any file, web developers use HTML.

  1. [Complete the HTML course on Codecademy][codeacademy-html].
  2. Create five websites with plain HTML. Play around with as many tags as you
     can. You can use [a random website idea generator][random-website] if
     you can't think of ideas.

* Do not learn CSS (yet), focus on writing good HTML.
* Do not memorize HTML tags, use [a reference][htmlreference] instead.
