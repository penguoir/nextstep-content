Great! Now comes the fun part:

  1. Create an *exciting* website using something that you haven't used before.
  2. Create a *practical* website. Something you might use every day.

Repeat these two steps for as long as you want. The more projects you work on,
the better you will get.

* You can find exciting JavaScript on [Mozilla's documentation of
  JavaScript][mozilla-javascript]. Read through and find something fun.
* When you make practical websites, solve problems which you encounter every
    day.
