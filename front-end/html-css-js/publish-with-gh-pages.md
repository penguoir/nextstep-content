Now that you have done a few projects, upload them to the Internet. GitHub
provides free hosting for static sites. This service is called "GitHub pages".

  1. Read the [documentation on how to upload projects][github-new-repo],
  2. Read the [documentation on how to use GitHub pages][github-pages].
  3. Upload your projects to GitHub pages.

**Note:** You don't have to name your repository anything specific (contrary to
what the documentation might imply).
