With the work you've done so far, you might have encountered some of the
following problems:

* Having to read through big HTML files.
* Writing the same code over and over again for the same effect. For example,
    three buttons that look the same but have different text require lots of
    repeated code.
* Complicated events and reactions to events. For example, showing dialogs
    or creating dropdown menus.

React solves these problems by letting you write HTML inside your JavaScript
code.

This section also covers other commonly-used JavaScript libraries.
