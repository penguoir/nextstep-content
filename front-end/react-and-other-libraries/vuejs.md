**Knowledge Section:** You only have to read the following section. It is
intended to provide you with an overview of existing technologies, so you have
the context for when you encounter them in the real world.

Vue.js has similar functionality to React. It provides ways to create
components, build interactions, maintain a state, and more. It is less popular
than React. However, it is the only primary JavaScript framework not to be
backed by a company. Facebook owns React; Google owns Angular (another
alternative). Vue.js is entirely open-source and maintained by the community.

If you'd like to learn more about Vue.js, you could get started by reading [the
Vue.js documentation][vuejs].
