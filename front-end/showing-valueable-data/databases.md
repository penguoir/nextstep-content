You've learned how to query APIs in the previous chapter. Now, it's time to make
your own. Most APIs need databases, a way of storing data for a long time.
Databases are the backbone of every website. It is essential to understand them.

  1. TODO: introduction to databases

  2. SQL is a way of telling your database what to do. It's different from other
  programming languages because you don't have to tell the database _how_ to do
  things, just what result you want. Complete [the Codecademy course on
  SQL][codecademy-sql].

  3. Now, you should build up experience with communicating with a database.
  Just like how you queried endpoints in the last chapter, you can query your
  database with a JavaScript library.

     TODO: find out a way to try out local development without any server-side
     things, find a pre-made one!! dog thing on GitHub??
       FOUND IT!! <https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server>  although,
       this is no-sql

  4. So far, you've looked at SQL databases. The next step is to look into the
     more modern `no-SQL` databases. These databases look more like objects than
     tables. Read through [the Firestore documentation][firestore-docs].

  5. Do five projects with Firebase.
