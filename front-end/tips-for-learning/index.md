Use the following tips to be more efficient with your learning.

* **Don't copy-paste.**

  If you copy-paste, you won't encounter as many bugs as you would when working
  usually. Programming is 80% debugging.

* **Read the entire chapter before moving on.**

  Some chapters tell you not to learn things. You won't know unless you read
  through it all.

* **Read slowly and methodically. When you get impatient, take a break.**

  Documentation is often insightful but boring. Everyone gets impatient, take
  a five-minute break when it happens.

* **Do not watch video tutorials. If you must, immediately apply what you've learned.**

  Video tutorials are "passive" learning. "Active" learning is more effective
  than "passive". You might watch a video and feel that you're learning, but
  if you don't apply what you've learned, you will forget it quickly.

* **Have fun.**

  If what you're trying to learn is boring, try to figure out how to
  use it in an actual project. If that doesn't work, move on to something else
  for a bit. Bored students don't learn well.
